<h1> brackets - resolver </h1>

The brackets resolver is a program that reads an event feed, a standard XML file produced by a Contest Control System, and reveals the judgements of pending runs (the results are animated). This makes sense for contests in which the scoreboard is frozen for a certain amount of time before the end. The brackets resolver can also be used as a scoreboard in which case it handles contest events as they arrive.
