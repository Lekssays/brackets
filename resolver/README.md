<h1> brackets - resolver </h1>

The brackets resolver is a program that reads an event feed, a standard XML file produced by a Contest Control System, and reveals the judgements of pending runs. The results are animated. The brackets resolver handles contest events as they arrive and it supports contests in which the scoreboard is frozen for a certain amount of time before the end of the contest.
